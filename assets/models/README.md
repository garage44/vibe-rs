# Fox Model

To use the fox avatar, download the `Fox.glb` model file from one of these sources:

1. **Bevy Examples**: Download from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/assets/models
   - Direct link: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/raw/main/assets/models/Fox.glb
   - Place it in this directory as `Fox.glb`

2. **Foxtrot Repository**: The foxtrot game uses a fox model at https://github.com/janhohenheim/foxtrot/tree/main/assets/models/fox
   - You can download the model files from there if available

The model should be placed as: `assets/models/Fox.glb`

The code will automatically load it when the avatar spawns.
